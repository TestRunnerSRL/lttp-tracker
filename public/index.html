    <h1>LttP Networked Item Tracker</h1>
    <p style="font-size: 1.4em;">Go to <span id="loc"></span>/[NAME] to view a tracker. If the name does not 
        already exist, you will be able to create the tracker. If it does exist, you will be able to watch the 
        tracker and, if the room creator gives you the passcode, update the tracker as well.</p>
    <p>If you have been given a passcode, you can enter it in the "Settings" panel by clicking the button in the
        lower-right hand side. There is no indication when you've entered the correct passcode, but you'll be
        able to update the tracker successfully if you did.</p>
    <p>Remember the passcode when you create a tracker. If your cookies clear, you will not be able to update
        the tracker without putting in the passcode.</p>
    <p>If you prefer a simpler version of the tracker, you can access one at <span id="loc2"></span>/simple/[NAME]
        that does not have map or chest tracking but does have a timer.</p>

        <li><strong>2017-09-24:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Tracker now supports any number or rows or columns for your layout. The method of modifying
                    layouts has changed slightly but it should be obvious enough.
                </li>
                <li>Bug fix for pushing a configuration: now, if you push a configuration, any browser going to
                    your tracker for the first time should use it. Configurations are also unique per room, 
                    if you visit a large number of tracker rooms.</li>
                <li>"Use Tourney Configuration" button for tournament restreamers.</li>
                <li>Bug fix involving dungeon labels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2017-09-06:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Agahnim now supports multiple modes for Aga 1, Aga 2, both, or neither defeated, to support 
                    Entrance Randomizer users. Obviously chest logic doesn't account for every ER possibility but
                    this was an easy request to fulfill.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>2017-08-14:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>v26: Waterfall of the Wishing added.</li>
                <li>v26: Logic for not having a sword added to various dungeons.</li>
                <li>There is currently no support for 'swordless' mode in the chest tracking. I assume most people
                    doing this mode don't need chest trackers anymore. If this is a feature you would use however,
                    feel free to let me know.

                <li>You can now push your configuration to other instances of your tracker.</li>
                <li>Dungeon labels exist. You can turn them off in settings.</li>
                <li>Default now no sword. Swordless-specific logic to be added at v26 release.</li>
